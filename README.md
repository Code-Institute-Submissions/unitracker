# Unitracker - Project 4

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DeanFlint/unitracker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DeanFlint/unitracker)

## Getting Started

Unitracker is a web application that allow users to report bugs, request features and view the details of each ticket.
The user can create an account, login, logout and view their profile. There is functionality to allow users to reset their password if needed. 

There are two types of tickets a user can submit. Bugs are available for any user to create and they also have the option to upvote other bug tickets. The developers are Unitracker will spend 50% of their time each working on the highest voted tickets. As developers are working on each ticket, they have the ability to change the status of the ticket (which include; 'to do', 'in progress' and 'done') which users can then see. 

The other type of ticket is a feature ticket. All users can view feature tickets however, only users that have donated Â£30 or more can post new feature tickets and upvote current feature tickets. The developers will spend the other 50% of their time each week working on feature tickets. Users have the functionality to donate however, it's not required if they only need to create bug tickets.

Users can order the view of both of the ticket types by name of ticket or status but by default, they are ordered by newest ticket submitted.

This app is written using Django, HTML, CSS and Javascript. It used Stripe as a means of allowing the user to donate and uses a sqlite and postgres database (depending on which environment is being used.)
